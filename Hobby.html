    <h1>My Hobby: Football</h1>

    <h3>This image of 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick is very
    Special to me, this was the first football game I had ever watched
    and it started my fandom and love not only for the 49ers 
    But football as a whole. Kaepernick set an at the time playoff 
    record for most rushing yards in a game, and to this day, it is
    The reason I prefer mobile QBs over pocket passers. Kap made the game 
    seem so fun, and in his later years, Kap showed me that players were 
    more than who they were on the field, I identified with him
    as an African-American. To me, Kap represented the type of QB and player I like the most
        versatile playmakers, he also inspired me to play football. After watching him and the 49ers play, I started playing football myself at the age of 7, and at the age of 19 I still play the sport</h3>

    <h3>This is me playing football for my high school, Kenwood. 
        I've been playing football since I was 7, and it was never as fun 
        And memorable as it was in high school, I'm in college for football now
        and it's really put things into perspective. Ever since I was a kid, I knew that 
        Playing football was always better than watching it; nothing can compare 
        to the feel of the game, and when I feel truly locked in, there's
        not a better feeling in the world for me. This really is a great sport.</h3>

    <h3>As an offensive lineman, people always think my position is the easiest thing ever, but if you 
        knew what it takes to be good at it you would know that every part of your body needs
        to come together to move someone, and if just one part is misaligned, it could ruin the rep
        very similar to the position in general. The o-line is the backbone of the offense; without them, the offense can't do anything, so it's kind of a high-pressure job, but it's really fun. I've been playing O-line since I started playing football. At first, I used to hate it, but now I ask myself why not? It's my favorite position on the field, the one I understand the most, and I love playing it. The things in this audio are just a small peek into
        the inner workings of an offensive lineman</h3>

    <h3>In this video are highlights of my current favorite player, Lamar Jackson. He's my favorite because I've followed him. Journey for a while from his college days, I always believed in him, and to see him turn into the player he is today makes me excited every time I watch him. He's one of the most electric players in the league, and is also an example of black excellence for black youth all around.</h3>
